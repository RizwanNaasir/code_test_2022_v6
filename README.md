# Code Analysis and Refactoring

## Here are some of the things I did to refactor the code:

1. Bumped Code Syntax to PHP 8.2
2. Removed all the redundant DOC Blocks because PHP 8.2 already has built in type hinting.
3. Refactored if else statements to match the code syntax.
4. Refactored reusable code to a separate function.
5. Rename variables to match the consistency of the code.
6. Removed unused variables.

Here are some general thought's on the code:

1. **BookingController.php**:
    - **Validation**: Consider using Laravel's built-in validation features to validate the input data. This can help make the code cleaner and more maintainable.
    - **Separation of Concerns**: The controller appears to contain a lot of logic. Consider moving some of this logic to dedicated service classes to keep the controller slim and focused on handling HTTP requests.
    - **Consistent Response**: Instead of returning an empty response with an error message, consider using Laravel's response methods (e.g., `response()->json()`) to provide consistent responses.
    - **Dependency Injection**: Utilize Laravel's dependency injection to inject the required dependencies into your controller methods, making the code more testable and maintainable.
    - **Middleware**: You might want to consider using middleware for authentication and authorization checks rather than performing them directly in the controller methods.

2. **BookingRepository.php**:
    - **Validation**: Similar to the controller, consider using Laravel's validation features to validate data before performing database operations.
    - **Query Builder**: When building queries, consider using the Laravel query builder for better readability and security.
    - **Method Documentation**: Add clear documentation to describe what each method does, including parameter descriptions and return types.

3. **TeHelper.php (willExpireAt)**:
    - Consider adding unit tests for this method to ensure it behaves as expected. You can use PHPUnit for writing tests.

4. **General Code Comments**:
    - Add comments to clarify the purpose and functionality of critical sections of code. This will help anyone reading the code understand its intent.

5. **Refactoring and Code Formatting**:
    - Ensure consistent code formatting throughout the codebase.
    - Look for opportunities to refactor repetitive code and promote code reuse.
